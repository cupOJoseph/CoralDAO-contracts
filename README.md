deployed moloch dao contract so reef can be dao first! created a sand dollar token, based on Maker vaults, with: create vault, deposit, borrow, payback and liquidate functionality. reef token price for the vaults is set manually by an owner, since chainlink or other oracles are not yet deployed. The owner can be updated to a moloch dao so the price setting is still decentralized.
